          Hi, my name is Dan. I'm a developer, artist, and business owner from
          Manchester, UK. For the past few years, I've been having fun trying
          out new dev projects, working on music, and building a magazine. I've
          always been facinated by creating & building new things, but like many
          people, I've found difficulty in keeping up momentum and following
          through on new ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Frankly, I'd like to push my skillset further. I like the idea of
          creating small, managable projects that I can continously grow along
          side my main hussles. Whether it's starting a new business, learning a
          new skill, reading a new book, this website will serve as a home for
          these concepts & ideas, I'll be actively documenting my journey in
          doing that from the ground up.
        </p>

          // <p>
