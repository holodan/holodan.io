          Hi, my name is Dan. I'm a developer, artist, and business owner from
          Manchester, UK. For the past few years I've been slowly gaining
          momentum with these ventures, but like many people, I feel as though I
          could be pushing my skills further. I've always been facinated by
          creating & building new things, but I've found where I fall short is
          keeping up momentum and following through on new ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like the idea of creating small, managble projects that I can
          continously grow along side my main hussles. Whether it's starting a
          brand, learning a new skill, reading a new book, this website will
          serve as a home for these concepts & ideas, and I'll be actively
          documenting my journey in growing these from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p>
          I recently read Steven Pressfield's <em>The War Of Art</em> in which
          he outlines our everyday battle with resistance. If you're looking for
          a kick up the #@!$, then I highly reccomend checking it out.
